# friendFinder
Welcome to my app: friendFinder! The user starts on the homepage, where he/she can read about how the app works and what formula it employs to compare their answers to everyone else's answers. Then they are supposed to click the button to go to the survey and fill out all of the questions. Each answer is stored in an array. Each index of that array is subtracted by the same index of every other users' array of answers. Then, the absolute values of all of the differences are added up and the user is alerted of the name of the person in the database who had the "lowest difference". This application is useful because it provides a data-driven match of two people: the user and another user in the database with the closest answers. Any user interested in finding out who is most like themselves would find this application very useful. The self evaluation survey also provides entertainment, as the user is prompted with interesting and personal questions. The app was developed solely by myself, Nicholas Ciambrone.
